## ZenUML vs Mermaid comparison

ZenUML shines as the preferred choice over Mermaid because of its straightforward interface that's easy to learn, catering to both new users and seasoned professionals. While Mermaid is known for its Markdown-like syntax, ZenUML emphasizes clarity and a model-first philosophy, which ensures meaningful diagrams over mere drawings.

ZenUML also introduces a fresh diagram rendering approach, distinguishing itself from traditional options:

1. **Custom Styles**: ZenUML renders diagrams as HTML elements, giving you the flexibility to customize styles. You can tweak colors, borders, fonts, and even opt for a hand-drawn look to make your diagrams stand out.

2. **Image Export**: Outputs in HTML can be converted to images effortlessly, a feature that's integrated into the [ZenUML Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-sequence/kcpganeflmhffnlofpdmcjklmdpbbmef).

3. **Searchable Diagrams**: The text-based nature of ZenUML's output enables easy searching through names and messages. Embedding these diagrams into documents makes them searchable, boosting accessibility and integration.

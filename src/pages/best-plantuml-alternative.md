## Why look for an alternative to PlantUML?

Many users are seeking alternatives to PlantUML for reasons such as:

- ✅ More intuitive interface
- ✅ Better integration with development tools or knowledge management tools
- ✅ Enhanced data privacy standard
- ✅ Higher quality diagrams with less effort

## ZenUML vs PlantUML comparison

ZenUML stands out as the preferred alternative to PlantUML because it offers an easy-to-use interface with a gentle learning curve, much while still providing powerful features for professional needs. While PlantUML has its powerful syntax and functionalities, ZenUML stays ahead with its readability and opinionated approach, insisting on a valid model rather than just any drawing.

Also, ZenUML takes an innovative approach to rendering diagrams, setting it apart from conventional tools. Here's how:

1. **Styling Freedom**: With ZenUML, diagrams are presented as HTML DOM elements, giving you the creative freedom to apply custom styles. You can change colors, borders, fonts, and even implement handwritten styles to make your diagrams uniquely yours.

2. **Image Conversion**: Even though the output is in HTML, you can still generate images from your diagrams. This functionality is seamlessly supported within the [ZenUML Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-sequence/kcpganeflmhffnlofpdmcjklmdpbbmef).

3. **Searchable Content**: Since the output is text-based, searching through participant names and messages within the diagrams is a breeze. Plus, if you embed these diagrams into other documents, they become fully indexable, enhancing accessibility and integration.

## Reasons ZenUML is the best alternative to PlantUML

ZenUML revolutionizes the way you see changes to your sequence diagrams:

- **No Waiting**: Forget about clicking a 'Submit' or 'Refresh' button. ZenUML updates your diagram instantly with each keystroke. It's all about efficiency and speed, with no backend server calls delaying your progress.
- **Live Preview**: As you type your DSL in ZenUML, you see the diagram take shape in real-time. This immediate feedback loop allows for a fluid and intuitive design experience.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Powered by [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), ZenUML smartly updates only what's new or changed. Unlike tools that re-render the entire diagram with every edit, ZenUML focuses on the alterations, ensuring a distraction-free environment.

# Best HTML Macro alternative for Confluence Cloud

Most people searching for an HTML macro alternative are not looking for a *better snippet field*. They are
looking for a way to put something **real and interactive** on a Confluence page — a prototype, a
self-contained dashboard, a small tool — and the snippet macro is the only tool they have found so far.

If that is you, the honest answer is that you want a different shape of app.

## The two shapes

**A snippet macro** takes markup you paste into a field and renders it. One file's worth of content. Anything
else — your stylesheet, your JavaScript, your images, your data — has to be inlined into that one blob or
loaded from an external CDN.

**A bundle app** takes the *folder* you already have. [Mini Sites for Confluence](/mini-sites) validates it,
scans it for accidentally included credentials, provisions it into an isolated sandbox, and renders it inline
on the page with relative paths intact.

## Comparison

| | Snippet-style HTML macro | Mini Sites for Confluence |
|---|---|---|
| Input | Markup pasted into a field | A folder, up to 2,000 files |
| Multi-file (CSS/JS/images/data) | Inline it, or use a CDN | Native — nested relative paths preserved |
| Per-file / per-bundle size | Practical limit of a text field | 25 MiB / 50 MiB |
| JavaScript | Runs | Runs |
| External CDN / API calls | Usually allowed | **Not allowed** — bundle your assets |
| Credential scanning before publish | No | Yes — AWS/GCP keys, tokens |
| Isolation | Depends on the app | One non-routable sandbox per macro instance |
| Access control | Page permissions | Page permissions (Forge, inherited) |
| Atlassian API scopes requested | Varies | None |
| Hosting to arrange | None | None |

## When the snippet macro is the right answer

Be honest with yourself before you switch:

- You are pasting a **third-party embed code** — a form, a video, a status badge. Use the snippet macro.
- You need to load a library **from a CDN at runtime**. Mini Sites' sandbox has no outbound network access;
  the snippet macro will suit you better.
- You want to inject CSS that restyles **the Confluence page itself**. That is outside a sandbox by
  definition.

## When the bundle app is the right answer

- The thing you want to embed is **a project on your disk**, not a paragraph of markup.
- Reviewers should be able to **click it**, not read a screenshot of it.
- You do not want to stand up hosting, and you do not want a second access list to keep in sync with the
  page.
- You care that whatever you upload is **checked for leaked credentials** before it goes anywhere.

Thirty-five seconds, all of it a real capture: a prototype gets published from the page editor, validated and
secret-scanned, and a teammate votes in it and settles the decision in the page comments.

## Questions people ask

**Can I migrate from an HTML macro to Mini Sites?**
If your macro content is self-contained markup, save it as `index.html`, put any CSS/JS next to it, and
publish the folder. If it depended on a CDN, download those assets into the folder first.

**Does it work on Confluence Data Center?**
No — Confluence **Cloud** only.

**What happens to already-published mini sites if the licence lapses?**
They keep rendering. What stops is publishing new bundles.

**Is there a free option?**
Pricing lives on the

— it is always current there.

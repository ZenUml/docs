# **Streamlining New Product Launches Through Process Re-engineering**

## Product Launch Process Description

The new product launch approval process involves four participants with different business roles: the Product Manager, the Marketing Manager, the Finance Manager, and the Legal Counsel. The goal of this process is to ensure that a new product is thoroughly vetted and approved before it is launched in the market.

## The Challenge: Lengthy Approval Processes

The original new product launch approval process at many companies takes a very long time, often **stretching for 6-12 weeks or more**. This significant **delay** can be attributed to several key factors:

- Complex approval processes involving **over 5-10 different teams**
- Unclear or inconsistent approval criteria
- Lack of collaboration and alignment between cross-functional teams

As a result, companies may **miss out on 80-90% of the target market opportunities**. Their competitors may gain an advantage by launching competing products **months earlier**.

## The Solution: Process Re-engineering

To improve the new product launch approval process, companies need to **reengineer their processes** to make them more efficient and effective. This requires the support functions teams to **re-define the approval criteria** and **key information required** from the product teams.

The first step in this process reengineering is for the product team to **decouple the product** and identify the **critical 20% information** required for each approval process.

Then all the approval sub-processes can happen in parallel, which saves sigificant turn around time from end to end.

## Key Factors for Successful Process Re-engineering

To ensure the success of the process re-engineering initiative for faster product launches, companies need to focus on the following **4 key factors**:

- **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Cross-functional collaboration with **weekly syncs** is essential for streamlining the new product launch approval process. This ensures all perspectives are considered, and approval criteria is aligned.

- **Clear Approval Criteria**: Well-defined approval criteria are essential for ensuring all teams understand requirements and the process is efficient.

- **Decoupling the Product**: Breaking down the product into modular components can identify key info for each approval and enable parallel reviews.

- **Leveraging Technology**: Workflow tools to automate approval tracking can **reduce process time by 50% or more**.

## Parallel Approvals and Reviews

Conducting approvals and reviews in **parallel** rather than in series can **eliminate over 2-3 weeks of delays**. For example:

- Marketing, finance, legal teams can review product proposal simultaneously rather than waiting for each team to complete reviews sequentially.

- Critical development work can begin as soon as relevant modules get approved rather than waiting for full product approval.

## Conclusion

Process re-engineering is critical for companies to improve time to market, reduce costs, and gain competitive advantage with new product launches. By focusing on cross-functional collaboration, clear criteria, decoupling, and technology, companies can **slash launch timelines by 40-60%**.

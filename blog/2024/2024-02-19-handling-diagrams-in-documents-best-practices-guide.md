## Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, effective knowledge management is essential for organizations to remain competitive and adapt quickly to changes. A critical aspect of knowledge management is handling diagrams in documents in a way that keeps them accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with business logic.

However, traditional methods of managing diagrams using static images or file attachments have significant limitations. In this guide, we will explore **the best practices and modern solutions** for handling diagrams in documents.

## The Pitfalls of Traditional Diagram Handling

Before looking at better approaches, let's examine why old-school methods for diagrams fall short:

- **Images cannot be edited once created** - Any changes mean re-creating the entire diagram, which is tedious and disruptive.

- **Attachments lead to version control issues** - Hard to ensure attached diagrams reflect the latest updates. Outdated diagrams get referenced frequently.

- **Tedious to update diagrams with business logic changes** - Significant manual effort needed to keep diagrams aligned as systems and processes evolve. High risk of inconsistencies.

## Smarter Ways to Handle Diagrams

Modern solutions overcome these challenges by representing diagrams in **textual or code-based formats**:

### Text-to-Diagram Conversion

- **Flexibility** - Text diagrams can be modified easily by editing the text.

- **Version control** - Text diagrams integrate smoothly with version control systems.

- **Consistency** - Standardized syntax/markup language promotes uniformity.

### Code-to-Diagram Conversion

- **Automation** - Diagrams can be generated automatically from code.

- **Adaptability** - Changes to business logic are easy to reflect in diagrams.

- **Reusability** - Diagrams can be reused across documents.
